Arrowing after entering fullscreen would not move channels correctly, if you selected another channel before entering fullscreen.
Split highlighting caused by above issue.
EoF - Application will now handle End of File errors properly.
Quick mute icon not fading on fullscreen.
Shows being 30 minutes offest to the left.

Added:
 
Frame by frame checking, which will allow the application to check if the video source is frozen.
Loading bar in fullscreen. We decided against adding loading text to keep the interface clean.
